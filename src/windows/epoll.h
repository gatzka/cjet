Function:    int epoll_startup()
Description: This function does necessary initialization for the epoll library.
While this equates to a noop in Linux, in Windows it does not.
Applications should call this function exactly once on startup.
The epoll library should not be used if startup fails!
Parameters:  None
Returns:     0 if startup was successful, nonzero otherwise

Function:    int epoll_create(int size)
Description: The size is a hint to the kernel regarding the size of the event backing store.
epoll_create returns a file descriptor for use with epoll.
This file descriptor must be closed with epoll_close.
Returns:     When successful, returns a non-negative integer identifying the descriptor.
When an error occurs, returns -1 and errno is set appropriately.
Errors:
CINVAL
size is not positive.
CNFILE
The system limit on the total number of open files has been reached.
CNOMEM
There was insufficient memory to create the kernel object.

Function:    int epoll_ctl(int epfd, int opcode, int fd, struct epoll_event* event)
Description: Control a epoll descriptor, epfd, by requesting that the operation opcode
be performed on the target file descriptor, fd. The event describes the
object linked to the file descriptor fd.
Returns zero on success, or -1 on error.

Function:    int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_event* events, int maxevents, int timeout)
Description: Wait for events on the epoll file descriptor epfd for a maximum time of timeout
milliseconds. The memory area pointed to by events will contain the events that
will be available for the caller. Up to maxevents are returned. The maxevents
parameter must be greater than zero. Specifying a timeout of -1 makes epoll_wait
wait indefinitely, while specifying a timeout equal to zero makes epoll_wait
return immediately even if no events are available.
Returns the number of file descriptors ready for the requested I/O, zero if
no file descriptor became ready before the requested timeout, or -1 on error.

Function:    int epoll_close(int epfd)
Description: Takes a epoll file descriptor to close.
Returns zero on success, or nonzero on error.
Failure to close a epoll file descriptor may result in memory leaks
and/or loss of data.
While in Linux epoll_close() is equivalent to close(), in Windows it is not.
To maintain portability, epoll_close must always be used for anything created
with epoll_create.
