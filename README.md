## Howto Build

### CMake
Create a build directory somewhere on you build machine and execute:

- `cmake <path/to/cjet-sources>`
- `make`
- Optionally run `make test` to execute the unit tests.

There are some options available to configure cjet at compile time. You
will find all these options in the file [defaults.cmake](cmake/defaults.cmake).
If you want to override these default values, you need to pass these
options to cmake, e.g. `cmake -DCONFIG_MAX_WRITE_BUFFER_SIZE=51200 -D...
<path/to/cjet-sources>`.

Per default, cjet is always built with hardening compile switches like
`-fpie`, `-fstack-protector` or `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`. This imposes a
little runtime overhead. You can disable all hardening by calling cmake
with `-DCONFIG_NO_HARDENING=1`.

### QBS
There is a second build method available, [qbs](http://doc.qt.io/qbs/).
Just create a build directory, change to it and run:
```
qbs -f <path/to/cjet-sources>/src/cjet.qbs
```
qbs has the ability to make parallel builds for multiple profiles. So
if you want to build with clang, gcc, arm-gcc, ppc-gcc (these are the names
of your qbs profiles), just run:
```
qbs -f <path/to/cjet-sources>/src/cjet.qbs debug-clang profile:clang qbs.buildVariant:debug release-clang profile:clang qbs.buildVariant:release debug-gcc profile:gcc qbs.buildVariant:debug release-gcc profile:gcc qbs.buildVariant:release
```

You can also configure cjet at compile time via qbs. You will find the
cjet specific configurations in
[generateCjetConfig.qbs](qbs/modules/generateCjetConfig/generateCjetConfig.qbs)
and the Linux specific configurations in
[generateOsConfig.qbs](qbs/modules/generateOsConfig/generateOsConfig.qbs).

You can override these defaults easily when calling qbs, for instance:
```
qbs -f <path/to/cjet-sources>/src/cjet.qbs profile:gcc generateCjetConfig.serverPort:4321 generateOsConfig.maxEpollEvents:11
```
Per default, cjet is always built with hardening compile switches like
`-fpie`, `-fstack-protector` or `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`. This imposes a
little runtime overhead. You can disable all hardening by calling qbs like:
```
qbs -f <path/to/cjet-sources>/src/cjet.qbs release hardening.enableHardening:false
```

In addition, there is also a qbs project for building cjet and running all unit tests:
```
qbs -f <path/to/cjet-sources>/all.qbs release profile:gcc [products.unittestRunner.showCoverageData:true]...
```
You can specify as many additional parallel builds by adding more
profiles. If `products.unittestRunner.showCoverageData:true` is given, the
coverage data is directly displayed in a web browser.

If you don't like waiting for the http-parse-tests to complete you can
disable them;
```
qbs -f <path/to/cjet-sources>/all.qbs release profile:gcc [projects.cjetUnitTests.buildHttpParserTest:false]...
```
If you have clang and clang-analyzer installed, you can run the static
code analyzer with
```
qbs -f <path/to/cjet-sources>/all.qbs release profile:clang cjet.runAnalyzer:true
```

You can generate call- and caller-graphs for the documentation with Doxygen. This
requires Graphviz to be installed on your system. It can be switched on with:
```
qbs -f <path/to/cjet-sources>/all.qbs generateDoxygen.createGraphs:true
```

## Howto run
Just execute `cjet.bin` to run cjet in daemon mode. There are some command line options available:
- -f to run cjet in foreground.
- -u \<username\> to run cjet with the privileges of a certain user
- -p \<password file\> specifies the credential file to use for authentication
- -r \<request target\> to specify the request target for the websocket jet access
- -l let cjet only listen on the loopback device
